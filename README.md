# Compound Interest Calculater
## Inspired from Investor.gov

Currently under construction.

To Do:

1: Complete calculate function in app.js file to include monthly contributions. *Working with monthly compounding. need to update for other compound frequencies*
~~2: Create a new element or popup window that displays the results. ~~
*At this point the calculator will be complete but as I learn more JS, I plan to add more functionality 
comparable to the one seen on investor.gov.
