# Compound Interest Calculater
## Inspired from Investor.gov

Allows you to calculate the estimated future value of an investment or savings account 
based on principle, interest rate, contributions, length of time, and compound frequency. 

I used basic HTML and CSS for the UI, did not spend much time on this.
Javascript is used for logic and displaying the answer after calculations. 


I struggled implementing the math formula for compound interest + contributions in javascript
and ended up resorting to if loops.
